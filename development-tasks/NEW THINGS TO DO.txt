--create macrodef that signs JARs (MD5, SHA512). Use gpg

--create strings library

--see if I can embed OSGi inside Orion so that I can
use libraries as bundles, more easily. Put it in the core

--a properties namespace is a prefix for a collection
of related properties. For example, props like:
core.my.new.property.1=hello
core.my.other.property.2=world
the namespace here is "core"
For props like:
designpatternsfacades.my.new.property.1=hello
designpatternsfacades.my.other.property.2=world
the namespace is "designpatternsfacades"

--event-driven in libraries. How can we create something like a Spring or Tomcat container so that the libraries are executed in an environment the core project can control?

--whenever something is "updated" at run-time, dynamically, use an "updater"

--we could enable "in-library" permissions. You could "login" in the library in order to use it
