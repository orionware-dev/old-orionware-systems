--*.prop files that are normal properties files
--*.oxml files (Orion XML) that are normal XML files
--*.osql files (OrionSQL) which will be a translation of MySQL commands in my way. E.g. "get DatabaseName.TableName" == "select * from DatabaseName.TableName;" or "get DatabaseName.TableName(column1, column2)" == "select column1, column2 from DatabaseName.TableName;", etc. and use it in the admintool and in the future maybe even in Java
