--interfaces can declare methods, but also "default" modifier in which we can
provide a default impl of the method inside the interface





--put 3rd-party libraries and Orion-generated ones in a common project
called "all-libraries" for easy visibility across projects. I know that
this way projects will not have their own lib dir with only the JARs
they need, but this way we would have several copies of the same JARs


--created a "libraries-builder" project that has the necessary Ant
files and prop files to build all the projects in the correct order
